Be sure to create your own config/facebooker.yml. I only set the api key, secret key and ports.
development:
  api_key: 
  secret_key: 
  canvas_page_name: 
  tunnel:
    public_host_username: 
    public_host: 
    public_port: 
    local_port: 
    
Developer tips:
It will not work on localhost. There are some ways to set up tunneling but when I am developing I 
map a domain name my publicly facing ip address and then have my router forward requests to port 
3000 to my computer. Then in my facebook settings I make the callback URL be something like 
http://znm.spongecell.com:3000/zack/connect. When developing your browser should point to 
http://znm.spongecell.com:3000.

Remember that your xd_receiver file must have the same path as the callback url.

Settings for the above are in environment.rb.
